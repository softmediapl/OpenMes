## Extensibility & Modules

OpenMES is built to be extended! Use our comprehensive **hook system** to add custom functionality without modifying core code.

A module drops into `backend/modules/`, is toggled in **Admin → Modules**, and
plugs into three kinds of extension point — with **zero runtime cost when
disabled**:

### Hook System

- **Domain events** — react to production activity:
  - Work orders — `WorkOrderCreated`, `WorkOrderUpdated`, `WorkOrderCompleted`
  - Batches & steps — `BatchCreated`, `StepStarted`, `StepCompleted`
  - Machine — `WorkstationStateChanged`, `MachineMessageReceived`
  - Users — `UserAssignedToLine`
  - **`ResourceChanged`** — a generic CRUD hook for **any** curated resource (work orders, customers, materials, lines, …) on create/update/delete
  - **`WorkOrderScheduled`** — a work order is placed/moved on the planner
- **Menu hooks** (`MenuRegistry`) — add links and dropdowns to the sidebar
- **Dashboard widget hooks** (`WidgetRegistry`) — add cards to the admin dashboard

### Create Custom Modules

```php
// In your module's ServiceProvider::boot()
use App\Events\WorkOrder\WorkOrderCompleted;
use App\Services\MenuRegistry;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;

// React to an order completing (observe — never mutate core state here)
Event::listen(WorkOrderCompleted::class, function ($event) {
    ExternalErp::notifyCompletion($event->workOrder);
});

// Add a link to the sidebar
app(MenuRegistry::class)->addItem('production', 'My Page', url('/modules/mine'));
```

### Example Use Cases

- **ERP Integration** - Sync with SAP, Odoo, or custom systems
- **Custom Notifications** - Email, SMS, Slack, Teams
- **Quality Control** - Automated inspections and checks
- **IoT Integration** - Connect machines and sensors
- **Custom Reports** - Generate PDFs, Excel, or API exports
- **Inventory Management** - Auto-update stock levels
- **Barcode/RFID** - Track materials and products

🛠️ **Build a module (step-by-step tutorial)**: [backend/modules/README.md](backend/modules/README.md) — from an empty folder to a running module, plus a code map of how it all works
📚 **Hook reference**: [HOOKS.md](HOOKS.md) — every event, menu and widget hook, with payloads and examples
📁 **Reference Modules**: [`backend/modules/ExampleShowcase`](backend/modules/ExampleShowcase) (all hooks) · [`backend/modules/ExampleHooks`](backend/modules/ExampleHooks) (minimal)

---

## 📦 Built-in Modules

OpenMES ships with optional modules that can be enabled from **Admin → Modules**.

### Packaging — EAN Barcode Scanning Station

Dedicated station for scanning finished products with a barcode reader (EAN/QR) before shipping or warehouse handoff.

**How it works:**

1. Operator opens `/packaging/station` on a dedicated workstation or tablet
2. Scans an EAN barcode with a USB/Bluetooth reader (or types it manually)
3. The system looks up which work order the EAN belongs to and increments its `packed_qty` counter
4. Live stats update every 3 seconds: packed today, plan, backlog, realisation %

**Features:**

- **EAN management** — assign one or multiple EAN codes to any work order (`Admin → Packaging → EAN Codes`)
- **Scan history** — every scan is logged with timestamp, user, and result (success / unknown EAN / error)
- **Shift-based counters** — `packed_qty` resets each shift; shift boundaries are configurable
- **Manual reset** — `php artisan packaging:reset-shift` resets all counters immediately
- **Admin dashboard** — read-only overview of all lines with the same live stats as the operator view

**Routes:**

| URL | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/packaging/station` | Operator, Supervisor, Admin | Scanning station |
| `/packaging/` | Supervisor, Admin | Admin overview |
| `/packaging/eans` | Supervisor, Admin | EAN code management |

**Required migrations** (run automatically on first deploy):

```
create_work_order_eans_table
create_packaging_scan_logs_table
add_packed_qty_to_work_orders_table
```

## Architecture

OpenMES uses a **dead-simple** Laravel monolith architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Laravel App    │  :80 (serves everything)
│  (Blade + API)  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────┐
    │ PostgreSQL│
    └──────────┘
```

**Stack:**
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 with Blade templates
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS 4 + Alpine.js for interactivity
- **Real-time**: Livewire 4 for dynamic components
- **Charts**: Chart.js for analytics
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 18+ with immutable audit logs
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (2 containers only!)

### Why This Architecture?

- **Ultra Simple**: Just 2 containers (Laravel + PostgreSQL)
- **One-Command Install**: clone, run installer, done
- **No Reverse Proxy**: Laravel serves directly on port 80
- **Easy Maintenance**: Single codebase, traditional Laravel patterns
- **LAN Optimized**: Server-rendered pages, perfect for local networks
- **Mobile Ready**: Responsive Blade templates work on tablets
- **Fast**: Built-in assets compilation with Vite

### ISA-95 Compatibility

OpenMES architecture maps onto the ISA-95 / IEC 62264 standard for Manufacturing Operations Management at Level 3. See [docs/isa95.md](./docs/isa95.md) for the full coverage matrix across Production, Maintenance, Quality, and Inventory operations.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (20.10+)
- Git

### Installation 🎯

**One command — clone and run the installer:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mes-Open/OpenMes.git
cd OpenMes
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` generates secure credentials into `.env`, **auto-selects a free host port** (80 if it's available, otherwise the next free one — e.g. 8080), builds the app from the cloned source, and starts it in **production**. When it finishes it prints your URL and admin login. Use `./install.sh --yes` to accept all defaults non-interactively.

**Windows?** In **PowerShell** (Docker Desktop) run the equivalent installer — same behaviour as `install.sh`:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

(Under WSL2 just use `./install.sh`.)

**Prefer plain Compose?** `docker compose up -d --build` also works — it builds from source and serves on port 80 (override with `HTTP_PORT`/`HTTPS_PORT` in `.env` if 80 is taken).

### First boot

With Docker, the database is migrated and the admin account is created
automatically on first boot (from the credentials in `.env`) — no manual wizard
step is needed. Open the URL the installer printed and log in.

> Running OpenMES outside Docker (bare PHP)? A web-based setup wizard guides you
> through database and admin configuration the first time you open the site.

### First Steps After Installation

1. **Login** with your admin credentials
2. **Create production lines** in the admin panel
3. **Add users** (operators, supervisors) and assign them to lines
4. **Import work orders** via CSV or create manually
5. **Install PWA on tablets** for offline support

### Troubleshooting

**Containers not starting?**
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild containers (if needed)
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

**Database connection errors?**
```bash
# Make sure postgres is healthy
docker-compose ps

# Check database credentials
grep DB_PASSWORD .env backend/.env

# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
```

**Application not loading?**
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker-compose ps

# View backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Rebuild backend (includes asset build)
docker-compose build --no-cache backend
docker-compose up -d
```

**Port 80 already in use?**
```bash
# Check what's using port 80
sudo lsof -i :80

# Edit docker-compose.yml to use different port:
# Change: - "80:8000" to "8080:8000"
# Then access at: http://localhost:8080
```

## Working on the React frontend

OpenMES is incrementally adopting **React via [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)** alongside the existing Blade + Livewire UI. Both render trees coexist — new pages can opt into React without touching anything else.

### Live-edit workflow (no local Node install required)

The point of this setup: pull the repo, drop it on a server (FTP/SSH/whatever), edit `.jsx` files in place, refresh the browser. No `npm install` on your laptop, no build step in your hands. A container handles it.

Start the stack with the dev overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

That overlay (`docker-compose.dev.yml`):

- Spins up a `frontend` container running `vite build --watch`. It watches `backend/resources/` and rebuilds `backend/public/build/` in ~100ms whenever you save a file.
- Bind-mounts the application source (`app/`, `routes/`, `resources/`, `public/`, …) into the backend container so PHP/Blade edits are live too.

Workflow:

1. Edit `backend/resources/js/Pages/Foo.jsx` (or any source file).
2. The watcher rebuilds automatically — check `docker compose logs -f frontend` if you want to see it.
3. Refresh the browser.

### Adding a new React page

1. Create the page component at `backend/resources/js/Pages/Foo.jsx`:

   ```jsx
   import { Head } from '@inertiajs/react';

   export default function Foo({ greeting }) {
       return (
           <>
               <Head title="Foo" />
               <h1>{greeting}</h1>
           </>
       );
   }
   ```

2. Add a route in `backend/routes/web.php`:

   ```php
   Route::get('/foo', fn () => Inertia::render('Foo', [
       'greeting' => 'Hello from Laravel',
   ]));
   ```

3. Visit `/foo`. Props from the controller arrive as React props.

### Production builds

Production deployments do not use `docker-compose.dev.yml`. The image's `Dockerfile` already runs `npm ci && npm run build` at image build time, so the production container ships with pre-built assets — no Node process at runtime.

---

## Live data sync (Electric SQL)

OpenMES uses [**Electric SQL**](https://electric-sql.com) for read-path live sync between Postgres and React/mobile clients. Instead of broadcasting events from Laravel and reconciling state on the client, clients **subscribe to a named shape** (a server-defined query) and Electric pushes changes from Postgres's WAL automatically. Writes still go through Laravel controllers as before.

### Architecture — gatekeeper, not proxy

Laravel **authorizes** a shape once and hands back a signed capability; the browser then streams from Electric **through Caddy**. PHP never holds the long-poll.

```
1. authorize:   client ─► GET /api/shapes/{name} (Laravel gatekeeper, authed)
                          ◄─ { url, params: { table, columns, where, exp, sig } }   (HMAC-signed)

2. stream:      client ─► /electric/* (Caddy) ──forward_auth──► /api/electric/authorize  (fast HMAC check)
                                       └──reverse_proxy──► Electric ─► Postgres WAL
                          ◄─ live shape updates via useShape()

   writes:      client ─► Laravel controllers (validation, auth, Eloquent events) ─► Postgres
```

- **Electric** runs as a sidecar container, talks to Postgres over logical replication.
- **Laravel** owns the shape registry (`app/Sync/Shapes/`) and the gatekeeper (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/ShapeGatekeeperController.php`): `config()` issues the signed shape, `verify()` is Caddy's `forward_auth` target. Clients request shapes by name, never by table.
- **Caddy** (`/electric/*` route) holds the ~20s long-polls and proxies them to Electric. Crucially, **the long-poll never occupies a PHP worker** — PHP only does the fast signature check per poll. This is what lets the stack scale to many concurrent live clients.
- **Clients** (React via `@electric-sql/react`, future mobile via `@electric-sql/client`) fetch the signed config, then stream from `/electric/*`.

> **Why a gatekeeper and not a straight proxy?** An earlier design proxied Electric's `live=true` long-poll *through* PHP. Because the dev server is single-threaded, one held long-poll froze the whole app (login 20s→90s+). Long-polls must be held by Caddy/Electric, never PHP.

### Prerequisites

Postgres must run with **logical replication** enabled. The base `docker-compose.yml` already passes the required flags:

```yaml
command:
  - postgres
  - -c
  - wal_level=logical
  - -c
  - max_replication_slots=10
  - -c
  - max_wal_senders=10
```

If you're connecting to a managed Postgres (RDS, Supabase, Neon, etc.), enable logical replication in the provider's console.

### Adding a new shape

Three files:

1. **Define the shape.** `backend/app/Sync/Shapes/MyShape.php`:

   ```php
   class MyShape extends Shape {
       public function table(): string { return 'my_table'; }
       public function columns(): array { return ['id', 'name', 'status']; }
       public function where(User $user): ?string {
           return "tenant_id = {$user->tenant_id}";
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Register it.** Add to the `$shapes` map in `backend/app/Sync/ShapeRegistry.php`:

   ```php
   'my_shape_name' => MyShape::class,
   ```

3. **Subscribe from React.** Fetch the signed config, then stream it (see `lib/useShapeConfigs.js` + `lib/useDashboardShapes.js` for the shared pattern):

   ```jsx
   // 1. authorize (quick, authenticated)
   const cfg = await fetch('/api/shapes/my_shape_name', {
       headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, Accept: 'application/json' },
   }).then((r) => r.json());

   // 2. stream from Electric via Caddy (absolute url required by the client)
   const { data } = useShape({ ...cfg, url: window.location.origin + cfg.url });
   ```

See `Pages/ElectricTest.jsx` and the `/electric-test` route for a working example.

### Security model

- Clients **cannot pick the table** — they pick a shape name. Adding a new shape is a deliberate code change.
- Clients **cannot pick which columns** to read — the shape's `columns()` method is the whitelist. Sensitive columns (password hashes, tokens, PII) simply aren't listed.
- Clients **cannot escape the server WHERE** — the HMAC signature covers `table`, `columns`, and the server-built `where`, so any tampering (widening scope, swapping the table, reading other columns) fails `verify()` with a 403 at the Caddy edge.
- The gatekeeper `config()` requires authentication (`auth:web,sanctum`). The signed capability expires (`exp`), bounding the leak window.

### Operational notes

- **Replication slot lag.** Electric maintains a Postgres replication slot called `electric_slot_default`. If Electric is down for an extended period, WAL accumulates on the Postgres volume. Monitor with:
  ```sql
  SELECT slot_name, pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), restart_lsn)) AS lag
  FROM pg_replication_slots;
  ```
- **Removing Electric.** Drop the slot first or Postgres will keep retaining WAL forever:
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('electric_slot_default');
  ```
- **App-server runtime.** The backend serves via **Laravel Octane on RoadRunner** (`octane:start` is the Dockerfile `CMD`) — a concurrent, in-memory runtime. The old `php artisan serve` was single-threaded and serialized every request; it remains only as a documented dev fallback. Octane keeps the framework booted between requests, so watch for state that assumes a fresh boot per request (singletons, static props) — validate the full app under Octane before a production rollout.
- **Signature expiry.** Issued shape capabilities carry a 1-hour `exp`. A dashboard left open past that will start getting 403s on poll; the client needs to re-fetch config from the gatekeeper on expiry (a refresh-on-403 hook — not yet wired in this PoC).
- **Production auth.** The `/electric-test` and `/admin/dashboard` routes use a short-lived Sanctum token passed as an Inertia prop to authorize the gatekeeper `config()` calls. Real pages should use Sanctum's [SPA stateful (cookie) mode](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum#spa-authentication) — no tokens, just the session cookie.
- **Widget registry regression.** The Blade dashboard supported a `WidgetRegistry` extension API where modules registered Blade views into named zones (`admin_dashboard.kpi`, `admin_dashboard.main`, `admin_dashboard.sidebar`). The React/Electric dashboard does **not** render these. No bundled module currently uses the registry, so nothing actively breaks — but a future React-based widget extension API needs to be designed before third-party modules can extend the new dashboard.
